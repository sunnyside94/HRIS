# HRIS
This project demonstrates end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and analysis of HR data, showcasing practical data engineering and analytics skills within a Human Resources context. It includes: ETL Pipeline, Exploratory Analysis, Tools &amp; Tech, and Business Value

# Tech
The Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM REST API lets you connect with and manage HR data in the Oracle Cloud system. It gives you a set of URLs (called endpoints) that you can use to do things like:
	•	Get employee info
	•	Add or update HR records
	•	Track absences, jobs, positions, and more

Use methods (like GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) to pull or change data

# This Project
Since I do not have access to Oracle Fusion, I will demonstrate my technical capabilities in this project by utilizing publicly available APIs and mock data. I will showcase my expertise in ETL processes, data visualization, and the development of meaningful metrics, all aimed at enabling insightful and data-driven decision-making.
