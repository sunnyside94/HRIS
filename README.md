# HRIS - Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and analysis of HR data, showcasing practical data engineering and analytics skills within a Human Resources context. It includes: ETL Pipeline, Exploratory Analysis, Tools &amp; Tech, and Business Value

# Current Understanding of System Design
The Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM REST API lets you connect with and manage HR data in the Oracle Cloud system. It gives you a set of URLs (called endpoints) that you can use to do things like:
	•	Get employee info
	•	Add or update HR records
	•	Track absences, jobs, positions, and more


# This Project
Since I do not have access to Oracle Fusion, I will demonstrate my technical capabilities in this project by utilizing publicly available APIs for mock data. I will showcase my expertise in ETL processes, data visualization, and the development of meaningful metrics, all aimed at enabling insightful and data-driven decision-making.

# Process
1. Create Dummy HR Data using Mockaroo
2. Consume Data in Google Colab
3. Transform Data
4. Create another dataset that mocks badge scans for employees
5. Provide insights
6. Feed data from Colab to Google Console which will allow querying using Google BigQuery
